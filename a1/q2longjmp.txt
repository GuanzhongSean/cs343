i. Reason of Different Output:
------------------------------------------------------------
The `dtors` count of `throwcatch` differs from that of `longjmp`. The mismatch in destructor counts occurs because throw-catch unwinds the stack and calls destructors for local objects, while longjmp skips this process entirely.

------------------------------------------------------------
ii. Timing Results:
------------------------------------------------------------
Arguments Passed: 12 12 103 28

Unoptimized Executables:
1. throwcatch:  7.26u 0.00s 0:07.26
2. longjmp:     1.40u 0.00s 0:01.41

Optimized Executables (-O2):
1. throwcatch:  7.16u 0.00s 0:07.17
2. longjmp:     1.39u 0.00s 0:01.39

------------------------------------------------------------
iii. Performance Difference (Without Optimization):
------------------------------------------------------------
The transformed program is significantly faster (~5x faster for the transformed program).
Reason for the Difference:
  - The `throw-catch` mechanism in C++ involves stack unwinding, which calls destructors and processes each frame of the call stack. This incurs significant overhead.
  - In contrast, `longjmp` directly restores the saved execution context without any stack unwinding, leading to much faster exception handling.

------------------------------------------------------------
iv. Performance Difference (With Optimization -O2):
------------------------------------------------------------
The transformed program remains significantly faster (~5x faster for the transformed program).
Reason for the Difference:
  - Compiler optimization improves both programs but does not eliminate the fundamental overhead of stack unwinding in `throw-catch`.
  - Optimizations such as inlining and reduced function calls have a limited impact on the exception-handling mechanism.
  - The transformed program benefits from the inherently low overhead of `longjmp`, which remains unaffected by stack-unwinding operations.
