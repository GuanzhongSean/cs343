A5Q2

In the Doctor Who episode Blink, at the climax, the Weeping Angels end up in a deadlock, not a livelock.

What Happens in the Scene?
- The Weeping Angels are a species that can only move when they are not being observed.
- At the climax, multiple Weeping Angels surround a TARDIS, and they are positioned in a circle, all staring at each other.
- Since an Angel turns to stone when observed, and each Angel in the circle is observing another, they all become permanently frozen.
- They can never move again because each Angel is both an observer and being observed simultaneously.

Why is This a Deadlock?
- Each Angel is waiting for another Angel to look away (which will never happen).
- No Angel can move because every Angel is being observed by another Angel.
- No further progress is possible, meaning they are permanently stuck.

Why is It Not a Livelock?
- In a livelock, entities keep reacting to each other but still fail to progress.
- The Angels do not keep adjusting their positionsâ€”they become permanently frozen.
- There is no back-and-forth motion or repeated state change.
